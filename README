scaledAnimationMetaDataToGameXml
================================

Perl script to parse Spriter SCML animation XML, and TexturePacker sprite atlas XML, and merge them into a custom XML 
output document. Similarly named frames in the input documents are identified, and given a GUID, linking the atlas sprites 
to animation objects.

Please see the comment block at the top of scaledAnimationMetaDataToGameXml.pl for details.
